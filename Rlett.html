            I don’t know how to start this . We are a complete strangers when we got met .I don’t even know how we got so close to eachother. When I saw you for the first time  I thought you were not my thing and I never thought of becoming friends , may be it was in my fate to have a sweet and kind one like you in my life .Do you remember? sometimes you used to ask me to tell (I love you ) , but I never did because I don’t like saying love you’s and all. I have a different love language I think Im there for you whenever you needed that is my kind of love  .I never expressed anything for you , because I don’t know how to show up, also you know how bad I am at expressing . I don’t know if you will believe this or not ….!  Did you remember the moment we thought of moving to some other room when we are in hostel but all of a sudden I ruined the entire plan because of some issues and you were angry about that and you didn’t talk to me for a few days ,you will never believe this …to be honest I was really unable to bear your silence at that moment. Its really hard for me to not talk to you.

    I had a great memories with you and I know I’ll never find a person like you . I’m sorry for getting angry at you sometimes ,but I feel I have all the right to do that with you . I used to not talk to you sometimes (actually a lot times ) I’m really sorry for that. I never told you before my mom really likes you a lot and all the dishes I get from my home are specially made for you and also she feels you are one of the member of our family . To be honest I have learned a lot of  things from you  and I can’t measure the worth of your support for me . And I must say this thanking you is really not enough for your patience and cooking delicious food for us. I think you are the pure soul I have ever seen and wish you are the same person always. I wish you are always this happy and childish , I cant bear to see you sad. Remember I’m always there for you. I’m sorry  if I ever hurt you and thank you so much for everything. I’m saying all this from my heart I feel you are a member of my family and you mean a lot in my life .4 years and 24/7 living together its quite a big journey and I want this journey to continue till my last breathe.

I can't put into words what your absence will mean.
